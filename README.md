### Abstract
The dilution effect hypothesis, which suggests greater host biodiversity can reduce infectious disease transmission, occurs in many systems but is not universal. Most studies only investigate dilution of a single parasite in a community, but many host communities have multiple parasites circulating. We studied a zooplankton host community with prior support for a dilution effect in laboratory- and field-based studies of a fungal parasite, Metschnikowia bicuspidata. We used paired experiments and field studies to ask whether dilution also occurred for a bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa. We hypothesized that the similarities between the parasites might mean the dilution pattern seen in Metschnikowia would also be seen in Pasteuria. However, because Daphnia–Pasteuria interactions have strong host–parasite genotype specificity, dilution may be less likely if diluter host genotypes vary in their capacity to dilute Pasteuria. In a lab experiment, Pasteuria prevalence in susceptible Daphnia dentifera was reduced strongly by higher densities of D. pulicaria and marginally by higher densities of D. retrocurva. In a second experiment, different D. pulicaria genotypes had similar capacity to dilute both Metschnikowia and Pasteuria, suggesting that Pasteuria’s strong host–parasite genotype specificity should not prevent dilution. However, we found no evidence for a dilution effect on the size of Pasteuria epidemics in D. dentifera in Midwestern U.S. lakes. Our finding that a second parasite infecting the same host community does not show a similar dilution effect in the field suggests the impact of biodiversity can differ even among parasites in the same host community.

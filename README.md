### Abstract
The dilution effect hypothesis, which suggests greater host biodiversity can reduce infectious disease transmission, occurs in many systems but is not universal. Most studies only investigate dilution of a single parasite in a community, but most hosts are infected with multiple parasites. We studied a zooplankton host community with prior support for a dilution effect for a fungal parasite, Metschnikowia bicuspidata, and used paired experiments and field studies to ask whether dilution also occurred for a bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa. In a lab experiment, Pasteuria prevalence in susceptible D. dentifera was reduced strongly by D. pulicaria and moderately by D. retrocurva. However, when analyzing variation in the size of Pasteuria epidemics in D. dentifera in Midwestern U.S. lakes, only the density of the primary host, D. dentifera, significantly predicted Pasteuria epidemic size. We hypothesized that this discrepancy between lab and field results might result from different infection dynamics of Metschnikowia and Pasteuria. Specifically, the strong host–parasite genotype specificity that characterizes Daphnia–Pasteuria interactions led us to hypothesize that D. pulicaria genotypes may vary in their capacity to dilute Pasteuria in D. dentifera, reducing dilution in the field. However, in a second experiment, different D. pulicaria genotypes had similar capacity to dilute both Metschnikowia and Pasteuria. Our finding that a second parasite infecting the same host community does not show the same dilution effect in the field suggests the impact of biodiversity on disease can differ even among parasites in the same host community.
